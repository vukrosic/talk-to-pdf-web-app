// 1. Code Constructor:
// Generate a task description that includes the problem statement and a list of required functionalities. Provide a mixed set of code snippets and pieces that cover all the necessary elements to solve the task. If the user is struggling, offer hints or suggestions to guide them towards selecting the correct code elements. Encourage the user to construct a working code by selecting and combining the provided code snippets appropriately.

// 2. Debug Detective:
// Generate a buggy code snippet that contains hidden bugs. Set a time limit for the user to identify and fix the bugs. If the user is struggling, offer clues or explanations to help them locate and resolve the issues. Once the user submits the corrected version, evaluate it to determine if the bugs have been successfully fixed. Provide feedback on the corrected code and highlight any remaining areas that need improvement.

// 3. Code Golf:
// Present a programming challenge that requires the user to write a solution using the shortest possible code. Specify the challenge requirements and constraints. Evaluate the user's solutions based on code length and functionality. Provide feedback on code efficiency and suggest optimizations to minimize code length or improve performance.

// 4. Code Dialogues:
// Engage in a coding dialogue with the user, taking turns to write code snippets to solve a task or create a program. Evaluate the user's code and provide constructive feedback. Extend or modify the user's code to encourage collaboration and further learning. Offer explanations for any changes made and suggest alternative approaches to problem-solving.

// 5. Time Travel Debugger:
// Generate a code snippet with simulated historical changes, including introduced errors. Provide a user interface to navigate through the code history and identify the source of errors. If the user gets stuck, offer guidance or hints to help them trace back and fix the errors. Emphasize the importance of understanding the code changes over time to locate and resolve the issues.

// 6. Pattern Matcher:
// Generate a series of example inputs and expected outputs for a pattern-matching problem. Ask the user to write regular expressions or other pattern-matching code to solve the problem. Evaluate the user's solution against the provided examples and provide feedback on correctness. Offer suggestions or optimizations to improve the solution if needed.

// 7. Pseudocode Pro:
// Generate pseudocode representations of algorithms or functions. Ask the user to convert the pseudocode into actual code in their chosen programming language. Provide the necessary context and requirements for the conversion. Check the final code for correctness by comparing it with the generated pseudocode. Offer feedback on any discrepancies or improvements that can be made.

// 8. Code Trivia:
// Host a quiz-style game where you ask coding-related questions. Provide multiple-choice or open-ended questions and evaluate the user's responses. Assign points for correct answers and time-based bonuses. Offer explanations and learning resources for incorrect responses to facilitate learning and understanding.

// 9. Test Case Titan:
// Generate code snippets that require unit tests to ensure correctness under different conditions. Ask the user to write effective test cases for the given code snippets. Evaluate the user's test cases to determine their effectiveness in covering various scenarios. Provide feedback on the quality of the test cases and suggest additional test cases if necessary.

// 10. Keyword Challenge:
// Provide a list of programming keywords and ask the user to create a code snippet that demonstrates the usage of each keyword. Evaluate the user's code for correctness and provide feedback. Offer suggestions on better usage or alternative approaches to showcase the functionality of the keywords effectively.
